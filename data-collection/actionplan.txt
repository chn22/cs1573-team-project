1) decide what to throw away

compare performance of clean examples with examples with noise:
release_month – replace with most occurring month in the dataset (10)
release_day –  replace with release_time and weekday
language – replace with most occurring language ('English')
writers – throw out
directors – throw out
rated – replace with 'unrated' 
actors – throw out
release_date – depends on what we decide to do with _month and _day above
genres – replace with most occurring genre ('Drama')
country – replace with most occurring country ('USA')

compute averages after culling data set, then replace
rating – replace with standard average of dataset (not the weighted average)
rating_count – replace with average of dataset

2) write a java function that throws away unclean examples
3) write a java function that replaces the missing values with the above

3) sequential forward selection
4) tree, neural network
